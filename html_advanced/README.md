### HTML Advanced Project.

In this project, I created a webpage from a designer file, focusing solely on the HTML structure without any CSS or styling. The webpage consists of two main parts: the head and the body. The body is further divided into the header, main, and footer sections. 

- Header: Contains menu links and the school page logo.
- Main: Divided into four sections: main_part, testimonials, tutorials, free_membership, and FAQ.
- Footer: Includes the school logo and links to social media. 

The emphasis was on using proper HTML semantics throughout the structure.
