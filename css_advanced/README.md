### CSS Advanced

This advanced project focuses on CSS and styling, aiming to replicate a Figma prototype using simple CSS elements. Key efforts include:

- Header Styling: Utilized color and positioning to correctly place the menu and logo.
- Main Section: Applied background images with precise dimensions for full coverage.
- Text Styling: Used `span` elements for specific color adjustments within sentences.
- Alignment and Button Design: Center-aligned objects and added rounded corners to buttons using `border-radius`.
- Typography: Applied italic font styles for testimonial paragraphs.
- Opacity: Used opacity settings to fade text in the F.A.Q. section and footer.

This approach ensures the webpage closely matches the Figma design while maintaining clean and efficient CSS code.
