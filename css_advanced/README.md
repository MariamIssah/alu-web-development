# Improve Africa: Transforming Africa with Innovation

## Mission Statement

At Improve Africa, our mission is to reduce Ghana's export of raw materials by partnering with companies that produce finished goods. In pursuit of this mission, we also aim to create job opportunities to alleviate unemployment and enhance agricultural productivity through mentorship and support.

## Project Overview

Improve Africa is a pioneering initiative developed by Awini Issah Mariam, a student at the African Leadership University in Kigali, Rwanda, and a proud Ghanaian. Our project is dedicated to collecting agricultural raw materials to boost the production of finished products, thereby adding value to our local produce.

## Our Raw Materials

We offer a variety of agricultural raw materials, including:

- Maize
- Millet
- Groundnuts
- Soybeans
- Beans

These materials are available in quantities ranging from 20 to 50 bags, depending on customer requirements. We offer competitive and affordable wholesale prices to ensure accessibility for all our clients. For instance, a bag of groundnuts is available for 1,500 cedis.

## Customer-Centric Approach

At Improve Africa, we prioritize the needs of our customers. If a specific type of raw material is not in stock, we go the extra mile to source and provide the required materials. Our commitment to customer satisfaction drives us to ensure that our clients receive exactly what they need.
